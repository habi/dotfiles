dotfiles
========

This repository is a collection of my `.dotfiles`.
Most of them are for my work machine which runs Linux, originally [Scientific Linux 6](https://www.scientificlinux.org/) from my first PostDoc, now switched to vanilla [Ubuntu](https://.ubuntu.com/).
Some dotfiles are also used on my home machine running OS X, so recently I switched this repository to [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
