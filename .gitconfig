    # According to http://stackoverflow.com/a/2850413/323100
    # `--no-commit` does not commit by default, allowing to make some
    # adjustments to the commit log before it gets committed. Useful
    # for adding additional info to the merge message
    # `--no-ff` always records a merge commit, even if the branch could
    # be fast-forwarded. See `A successful Git branching model` on
